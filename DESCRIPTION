Description: Solves goal programming problems of the weighted and  
    lexicographic type, as well as combinations of the two, as described 
    by Ignizio (1983) <doi:10.1016/0305-0548(83)90003-5>. Allows for 
    a simple human-readable input describing the problem as a series 
    of equations. Relies on the 'lpSolve' package to solve the underlying 
    linear optimisation problem.
